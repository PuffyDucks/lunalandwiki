Made this today (October 12, 2024)
# Ingredients
- [ ] 2.5 cup warm water
- [ ] 1 tbsp sugar
- [ ] 1 tsp dry yeast
- [ ] 2 tbsp olive oil
- [ ] 1 tbsp salt
- [ ] Many cups of bread flour
- [ ] Toppings
# Instructions
1. Mix water, sugar, and yeast. Wait 5 mins and check for yeast activity(this is to make sure your yeast didn't die).
2. Mix in olive oil, salt, and flour. Start with 4-5 cups of flour, and add more as needed while kneading. It's difficult to give an amount in volume because the amount of air can drastically affect flour density. It's best to use your own judgement!
3. Split into bowls, cover, and let rise in fridge for a few hours to 5 days. The longer the yummier!!
4. Stretch flat onto pan and cover in sauce and toppings of choice. Low moisture whole milk mozzarella is goated!!
5. Blast it in the oven at the highest temp possible :) 500 degrees minimum!!! Once again, use your judgement for timing!! Keep an eye on the pizza and wait for the cheese and crust to bake to a beautiful color!! Be sure the dough is fully cooked as well. Enjoy!!
