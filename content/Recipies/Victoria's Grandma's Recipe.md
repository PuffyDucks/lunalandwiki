I showed my friend Victoria [[Recipies/Gam Gam's Hot Banana Water|Gam Gam's Hot Banana Water]] and it reminded her of a recipe her grandmother made her drink. I hope you enjoy. Give it to your unsuspecting granddaughter and tell her its good for her.
# Ingredients
- [ ] 1 pear, preferably Asian
- [ ] 1 onion
- [ ] 4 cups water
# Instructions
1. Cut the pear like an apple, into wedges
2. Cut the onion like an apple, into wedges
3. Boil everything in the water until the water turns brown
4. This is what she told me word for word I swear this isn't a bit she says it tastes really bad but drank it all
