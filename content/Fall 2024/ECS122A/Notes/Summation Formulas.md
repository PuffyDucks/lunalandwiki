The main formula to know is the geometric series formula:
$$
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}ar^k=\dfrac{a(1-r^{n+1})}{1-r}
$$

The following can be derived from the above equation

When $|r|<1$, then as $n$ approaches $\infty$,  
$$
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}ar^k=\dfrac{a}{1-r}
$$

When $r=1$, then
$$
\sum\limits_{k=0}^{n}a=a(n+1)
$$
