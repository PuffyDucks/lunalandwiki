### Set
- Collection of things
- Represented with uppercase letters 
- Elements represented with lowercase letters

$\in$: Set inclusion, e.g. $x \in A$  means x is an element of set $A$  
$\notin$: Not element of 

Sets are defined with elements or a rule  
$A=\{1,2,3\}$  
$B=\{x\mid0\le x\le 5\}$

$S$: Set of all things of interest  
$\varnothing$: Null set, no elements: $\varnothing$={}  
$\cup$: Union, same as "or"  
$\cap$: Intersection, same as "and"
### Complement
$A^{c}$ represents elements of $S$ not in $A$. Complement of $S$ is $\varnothing$.

### Mutually exclusive 
Disjoint, sets share no element.  
$A_{i}\cup A_{j}=\varnothing, i\neq j$

### Collectively exhaustive
Sets make up all of $S$  
$A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots\cup A_{n}=S$

### Partition
Both mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive
