$\perp$: Independence between [[Spring 2024/EEC161/Notes/Experiment Terminology#^2613a6|events]]  
$A\perp B$ *if and only if* $P[A\cap B]=P[A]P[B]$
### Mutual independence
Within a collection of more than two [[Spring 2024/EEC161/Notes/Experiment Terminology#^2613a6|events]], every combination of events are independent.  
$P[A_1\cap A_2\cdots\cap A_n]=P[A_1]P[A_2]\cdots P[A_n]$
