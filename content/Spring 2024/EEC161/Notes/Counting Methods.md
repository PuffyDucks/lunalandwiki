There are $m^n$ ordered ways to choose $n$ objects out of $m$ objects with replacement.
## Permutation
Number of ways to choose $k$ objects out of $n$, where order matters.  
$_nP_r=\dfrac{n!}{(n-r)!}$
## Combination
Number of ways to choose $r$ objects out of $n$, where order does not matter.  
$_nC_k=\dbinom{n}{k}=\dfrac{(n)_k}{k!}=\dfrac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$  
The number of $n$ long sequences from $S=\{0, 1\}$ where 1 appears $n_1$ times is $\dbinom{n}{n_1}$
## what idk figure this out later (update: i never figured this out lol)
For $n$ repetitions of sub-experiment with sample space $S=\{s_0,\cdots,s_{m-1}\}$, number of length $n=n_0+\dots+n_{m-1}$ observation sequences with $s_i$ appearing $n_i$ times  
$\dbinom{n}{n_0,\cdots,n_{m-1}}=\dfrac{n!}{n_0!n_1!\cdots n_{m-1}!}$
